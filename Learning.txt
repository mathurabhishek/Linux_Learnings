Advanced Linux


What is kernel?
	Kernel is just another program with name vmlinuz-<kernelversion>
	Kernel, like any other program, accepts command line paramaters.
	These parameters are provided to the kernel by the bootloader,
	GRUB

How to interact with kernel ?

APIs
	APIs provided by kernel are called System Calls. These are the functions which can be called from
	user space into the kernel.

FileSystems
	proc, sys,debugfs, devicefiles to interact with devices

What does kernel do?
	Gatekeeper. Enforces privelages.
	Root processes - all privelages. Some CPU instructions can only be executed by linux kernel
	Security Policies. Controls access to hardware.

About kernel
	small size. boots to user space. additional functionality can be loaded from user space.kernel program
	is located in /boot

System Calls
	1.	System calls are functions implemented by the Linux kernel which are meant to be called from the
		user space. List of system calls is available in include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h in kernel source.
	2.	Number of system calls varies from architecture to architecture
		and with kernel versions. 
	3.	System calls are documented in man section 2.
	4.	System call wrappers are implemneted in standard library(libc). Standard C library (invokes the system call based on the
		architecture. So User_space -> Standard C Library ( architecture dependant0 -> Linux_Kernel
	5	If the system call fails then the kernel will return let's say -10 to the library function call. The library function call
		will then return -1 to the user space calling function and will the global 'errno' vraible value to 10.
	6.	Remember that errno could have stale value if the call is successful. So check for errno only whne you get a -1 return value from
		the system call made through standard C library
	7.	Man pages describe the system call from the standard C library perspective, so for 'read' you'll find a single
		description in man pages but in the unistd.h header file , you'll see multiple definitions depending upon the architecture
	8.	To read man page of system calls use : man system_call 2 ( remmeber 2 is for system calls. 1 is for coammands).
		So 'man kill 1' is for 'kill' command

Linux Kernel Messages
	1.	printk is used for printing deubug messages
	2.	with dmesg, we read the messages from RAM buffer
	3	journalctl is the one which could be used to see historic messages on the disk
