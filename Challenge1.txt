1.	What version is your linux kernel running ?
Ans	Do cat /proc/version

2.	What is the size of kernel file that corresponds to the
	kernel that your system is running.
Ans.	Search for vmlinuz in boot directory witht the same version as 
	the kernel from above. Do ls -la. Around 11 MB in my case.

3.	How much RAM is available to your running kernel ?
Ans.	See MemAvilable in meminfo
	https://tldp.org/LDP/tlk/mm/memory.html
	https://lynxbee.com/understanding-proc-meminfo-analyzing-linux-memory-utilization/
 
4. 	Using strace,	determine  which system call is made the most by the command date.   
Ans	strace date --summary

5.	How can you strace a builtin command like "cd" ?
Ans.	Attach strace to the bash. Open two terminals. from one terminal, attach  strace to he
	Bash running in other terminal.Now invoke the cd command in the terminal to which strace os attached.

6. 	How many system calls are dfined in your kernel source?
Ans.	Look into /usr/src/linux-hwe-5.11.40xxxxx/include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h in your running system
	Otherwise available in usr/include/uapi/asm-generic if you're looking into the source code.Look
	for __NR. In my system it's 346.

7.	What file descriptors does sleep function open ?
Ans.	It opens up the pseudo terminal file descriptor for the terminal from which it is invoked. Points to /dev/pts. 
	could be seen in /proc/pid/fd where pid is the pid returned after entering the sleep command.

8.	Does your system has a PCI device?	
Ans.	Yes. run lspci Or look into the the /sys.


9.	What's the value of kernel variable ip_forward(/proc/sys) in your system ?
Ans. 	found in /proc/sys/net/ipv4. The value is 0.

10.	According to /sys/bock do you have a block device sda ? If So , do you have
	device files partitions of sda?How many? Using Strace, does the command fdisk -l ( run as root), opens any files
	under /sys/dev/block ?
Ans.	Did that. Found that some of these are virtual. The real ones are mapped to /sys/dev/block

11.	Get info on kernel boot log.
Ans. 	Could be found from dmesg ( if it's not lost). Kern.log is persistent across boots. Syslog gives for current
	boot

12.	What other devices share major number with /dev/null?
Ans.	full, kmsg, mem, null, port, random, urandom, zero


Solutions:

1.	uname -r
2.	sizeof file pointed by vmlinuz in /boot
3.	free or cat /proc/meminfo
4.	use--> strace -c date
info*	To grep both stdout and stderr pipe with &
	So strace date |& grep read/write
5.	cd is a builtin command which invokes system call 'chdir'. So this is done by shell itself and not by a separate process.
	So write a script with a cd and put strace on script

6.	grep "define __NR" unistd.h | wc -l . System call numbers aren't consecutive
7.	stdout stderr stdinfo /dev/pts/1
8.	
9.	
Info*	you can pipe find's output to grep for better regex
10.	
12.	Just because you have a device file, doesn't mean that you have a device.
